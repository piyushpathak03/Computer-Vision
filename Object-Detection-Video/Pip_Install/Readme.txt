Download the get-pip.py installer script: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
If you’re on Python 3.2, you’ll need this version of get-pip.py instead. Either way, right-click on the link and select Save As… and save it to any safe location, such as your Downloads folder.
Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the get-pip.py file.
