<br/>Object detection is a branch of Computer Vision, in which visually observable objects that are in images of videos can be detected, localized, and recognized by computers. An image is a single frame that captures a single-static instance of a naturally occurring event <br/>On the other hand, a video contains many instances of static images displayed in one second, inducing the effect of viewing a naturally occurring event.

<br/>A Python library called ImageAI

<br/>Install on your computer is Python 3.
<br/>
<br/>pip3 install the following dependencies:

<br/>i. 		TensorFlow (tensorflow)
<br/>ii. 	Numpy (numpy)
<br/>iii.	SciPy (scipy)
<br/>iv. 	OpenCV (opencv-python)
<br/>v. 		Pillow (pillow)
<br/>vi. 	Matplotlib (matplotlib)
<br/>vii. 	H5py (h5py)
<br/>viii. 	Keras (keras)
<br/>ix. 	ImageAI (https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl )

<br/>
<br/>We use trained YOLOv3 computer vision model to perform the detection and recognition tasks
<br/>Download YOLO here:
